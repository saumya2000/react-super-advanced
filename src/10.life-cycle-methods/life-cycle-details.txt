Life cycle methods
-----------------------
when we create a react component that component goes through
several stages in its life cycle

*life cycle methods are only available on class components 
 not in functional components

 MOUNTING
 -------------
 when an instance of the component is being created and inserted
 into the DOM

 1.constructor  
    - a special function that will get called whenever a new component is created
    -if you want to initialize state
    -binding the evenhandler
    -never use constructor for HTTP request(Ajax calls)

    Notes
    ======
    1.we have to call special function 'super' this will call the base constructor

 2.static getDerived
 3.render
 4.componentDidMount


 UPDATING
 -------------
when a component is being re-rendered changes will be made to 
either props or state

1.static getDerivedStateFromProps
2.shouldComponnetUpdate
3.render
4.getSnapShotBeforeUpdate
5.componentDidUpdate

 UNMOUNTING
 -------------
when component is being removed from the DOM

1.componentUnMount

 ERROR HANDLING
 -------------
 When there is an error during rendering,in a life cycle method 
 or in the constructor
